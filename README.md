# AI-Based-Sign-Language-Recognition-Using-NVIDIA-Isaac-Sim
This project focuses on enabling real-time communication for non-verbal users by converting sign language gestures into text and audio output. The system uses NVIDIA Isaac Sim to generate synthetic hand gesture data and trains a deep learning model to recognize and translate signs.
